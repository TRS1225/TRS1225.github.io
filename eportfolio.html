    <p>      Here, I will use examples to demonstrate how the advancement of my software engineering skills, as well as the knowledge that I have gained in the process of completing the Computer Science Bachelor‚Äôs Degree program at SNHU have been fundamental to progressing on the pathway of an engineer. This coursework has allowed me to learn in-depth of various programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++, as well as how to build data structures and implement algorithms, along with other software development projects including full stack applications, 3D graphics design and rendering of scenes, as well as Android mobile application architecture. Aside from these technical skills, I also learned how to operate within the Scrum framework, an agile methodology employed by development teams to manage the Software Development Lifecycle, in addition to various other methodologies pertaining to the project life cycle.</p>
      <p>      At this time, I will provide examples of completed coursework from my degree program with screenshots to demonstrate various skills and knowledge which were acquired in the process of completing my degree program.</p>

      <h2>Full Stack Development</h2>

      <p>      In a course titled "Full Stack Development", I built a full stack web application utilizing MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) components. In this case, the web application that I developed allowed users to select and book various travel vacation packages for a client. During the beginning stages of application development, all the application logic had been handled by the server, with webpages rendered server-side, and thus presented to the browser (client-side) for display. Controllers, models, routes were developed in JavaScript to build the user interface of the application. Express was then used to retrieve and render static HTML via the utilization of Handlebars (HBS) template views, which were populated using data from the database application, MongoDB.</p>
      <p>      We later transitioned this application into a single-page application (SPA), which utilized API calls to fetch and manipulate data. To accomplish this, we used Angular as the basis for this coding framework. SPA is a form of web application development where all the application rendering happens on the client-side. This minimizes client-server traffic. After the transition to SPA, the only calls which were necessary to make to the server-side were made to retrieve data stored in the database.</p>
      <p>      Here is a screenshot of a sequence diagram made for this web application referring to the path by which a user's actions (or route) taken within their browser is handled by the application itself. The route, in this case, refers to the web address and link clicks that a user can perform within the app. These actions included signing in, viewing website information, and administrative actions:</p>
